# WeatherApplication
Final project for DSC510
For this class project I created an application that interacts with a webservice in order to obtain data.
This program uses all of the information that Iâ€™ve learned in the class in order to create a useful application.
This program must prompts the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.
This program then displays the weather information in a READABLE format to the user.
